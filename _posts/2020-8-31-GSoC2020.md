title: GSoC 2020
---

During GSoC 2020 I had the pleasure to work with the Honeynet Project, in particular on Cuckoo, their well known malware sandbox project. The project’s name was titled 'Analytical Malware Classification' and was mentored by [Ricardo van Zutphen](https://github.com/RicoVZ).

## Goal of the project 

Cuckoo Sandbox is currently undergoing a complete redesign, the new version will be released in the coming months. The goal of the project was to build a proof of concept module that uses an analytical approach to classify malware behavior into one or more categories. Additionally the project aimed to create new signatures for detecting malicious behavior, starting with Ransomware and then focusing on Trojan-like behavior, specifically for the Emotet family.

## Description

While researching upon malware categories and their behavior was a big part of the project, it also involved getting familiar with the new Cuckoo architecture.
During the sandbox analysis, Cuckoo’s kernel monitor would log certain events, which for example include:

* Process creation, termination, injection etc.
* File creation, modification, deletion etc.
* Mutants
* Networkflows
* Registry modifications
* Predefined suspicious behavior

and output the logged events into a .pb file, which was named Threemon. Threemon is based on [Google’s protocol buffer language](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview), which makes it possible to stream events directly from file.

The PoC that was developed during the project takes the .pb file as input, reads every event, tries to match the events to malicious behavior and classifies the analyzed sample to one or more categories. While the first version during the project required the user to convert the Threemon file to a json formatted output for further analysis, the second version is able to parse the events directly from the pb file. Additionally, support for creating a detailed pdf report was added, that included every matched signature and the events it was triggered by. The signatures where partially self developed during the research phase and partially taken from Cuckoo's signature database and converted to be able to work with the PoC's structure. Most of the signatures where assigned to one or more TTP numbers, where as TTP stands for Tactics, Techniques and Procedures and describes patterns of activities or methods associated with a specific threat. Each TTP number matches a certain threat activity / behavior, which can be looked up at [MITRE](https://attack.mitre.org).

## What has been done so far

* Strongly researched Ransomware behavior [here](https://github.com/agiix/analytical-malware-classification/blob/master/malware/ransomware/classification.md) 
* I documented the stats of every analyzed Ransomware sample with Cuckoo [here](https://github.com/agiix/analytical-malware-classification/tree/master/malware/ransomware/stats)
* Researched Emotet behavior [here](https://github.com/agiix/analytical-malware-classification/blob/master/malware/trojan/emotet/readme.md)
* I documented the stats of every analyzed Emotet sample with Cuckoo [here](https://github.com/agiix/analytical-malware-classification/tree/master/malware/trojan/emotet/stats)
* Created a Python script that parses Threemon events from a proto-buf file, matches the events to sigantures and outputs a summary for the user [here](https://github.com/agiix/analytical-malware-classification/blob/master/onemonparser.py)
* Added PDF report feature [here](https://github.com/agiix/analytical-malware-classification/blob/master/report.py)
* Added TTP [here](https://github.com/agiix/analytical-malware-classification/blob/master/ttps.json) and malware category description [here](https://github.com/agiix/analytical-malware-classification/blob/master/malware-description.json)

## What needs to be done in the future

* The malware categorization is currently done by simply matching each TTP to a particular malware category, which is prone to false positives. Signature like [ADS](https://github.com/agiix/analytical-malware-classification/blob/master/sigs/persistence_ads.py), [ExecBitsAdmin](https://github.com/agiix/analytical-malware-classification/blob/master/sigs/exec_bitsadmin.py), [CreatesExe](https://github.com/agiix/analytical-malware-classification/blob/master/sigs/creates_exe.py) or [DeletesExecutedFiles](https://github.com/agiix/analytical-malware-classification/blob/master/sigs/deletes_executed.py) are to generic to attribute to a specific malware category, it is therefore important to create a more precise approach.
* Creating more and updating already existing signatures. Signatures like [BrowserStealer](https://github.com/agiix/analytical-malware-classification/blob/master/sigs/infostealer_browser_modifications.py) check if certain files, which are known to hold sensible information collected by the browser, where read from. Those file locations tend to change over time and therefore some research is needed to update the file paths accordingly.
* A scoring system is missing, that gives each analyzed sample a score, for example from 1 to 10, to indicate how malicious the captured events are. One possible approach might be to assign every signature with a severity score. 

## Attribution
I want to thank the Honeynet Projet and the awesome team at Hatching for this unique and awesome opportunity. You are the best at what you are doing. 

My biggest thanks goes to my mentor Ricardo, for the great time while working on the project. You are clearly an expert in what you are doing and I learned so much from you. I couldn't have asked for a better mentor, keep up the great work!

As for me personally, I had to chance to dive depper into the field of malware analysis with people that share the same passion. I am grateful to have had the chance to participate in this years GSoC and learn a lot about the development of open source peoject and I am looking forward to keep contributing to this great community and project.
