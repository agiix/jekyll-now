During GSoC 2020 I had the pleasure to work with the Honeynet Project, in particular on Cuckoo, their well known malware sandbox project. The project’s name was titled 'Analytical Malware Classification' and was mentored by [Ricardo van Zutphen](https://github.com/RicoVZ).

## Description

Cuckoo Sandbox is currently undergoing a complete redesign, the new version will be released in the coming months. The goal of the project was to build a proof of concept module that uses an analytical approach to classify malware behavior into one or more categories. 

This included a lot of research on particular malware categories and getting familiar with the new Cuckoo architecture, especially with Threemon, the new data structure Cuckoo is using for its analysis results, which is based on [Google’s protocol buffer language](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview), which makes it possible to streams events directly from Threemon. 

The PoC takes a Threemon file as input, analysis every event, tries to match the events to malicious behavior and classifies the analyzed sample to one or more categories. While the first version during the project required the user to convert the Threemon file to a json formatted output for further analysis, the second version is able to parse the events directly from the proto buf.
