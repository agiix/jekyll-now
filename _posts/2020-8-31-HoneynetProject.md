## Introduction

Cuckoo Sandbox is currently undergoing a complete redesign, the new version will be released in the coming months. The goal of the project was to build a proof of concept module that uses an analytical approach to classify malware behavior into one or more categories. Additionally the project aimed to create new signatures for detecting malicious behavior, starting with Ransomware and then focusing on Trojan-like behavior, specifically for the Emotet family.
